What is the project that you are currently working on or would like to pursue? Why? (Max: 500 characters - about 100 words)

Ex. I’m building relentless, which is a job search service that helps people land the best jobs possible in the shortest amount of time. We do this by coaching people on every stop of the job search process, from writing a good resume, to landing interviews, to closing on an offer and negotiating compensation. I started this company after landing 40+ interviews and multiple offers during my job search and realizing that most people struggle to land even 1.

What problem are you solving? (Max: 500 characters - about 100 words)

Ex. Landing a job requires sales and marketing skills, but most job seekers have not been trained in sales and marketing. This skill gap leads to more time spent searching for a job and lower offer compensation levels.

What expertise do you have to execute on the work that you want to do? (Max: 500 characters - about 100 words)

Ex. I landed 40+ interviews and several job offers by automating my job search. Since starting a few months ago, I’ve booked $35k in revenue, closed 8 customers for my beta cohort (2 of whom got jobs), and grown to 10k+ followers across a newsletter and my linkedin. Prior to starting this, I worked in sales and marketing roles at VC-backed startups across Silicon Valley and New York.

What non-traditional things were you doing growing up?

Tell us about a risk you’ve taken or a challenge you’ve faced. Tell us whether you failed or succeeded, how you behaved, and how you think this reflects your character. (Max: 500 characters - about 100 words)

Ex. I scraped my school’s email server’s and cold emailed all 70k people at my school to get the first few thousand users for my previous company. I got sent to the Dean’s office and almost got kicked out of school, with 1 semester of college left. I’m here on a visa so getting kicked out of school may have lead to my visa getting revoked. I think this reflects my willingness to break rules and social norms to be successful.
